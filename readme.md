Some of the features I added to my guessing game was a way to find out more about me. I set this up as a way to prompt the user to take a guess a total of six times. Some features I would like to add are the ability to decern if the hints are getting close. This is far out of the scope at which I am capable of doing at this time. 

James was my partner in this project, overall he was very helpfull and I look forward to working with him again.
